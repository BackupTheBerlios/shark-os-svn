ABOUT THIS AREA
================
This subverion repository is hosted at berlios.de
This SVN area is the development arena we have decided to use to create the 
scripts we use and/or need to create the SharkOS Distribution.

Directory Setup
===============
The Directory structure is done as follows,
PROJECT_NAME
     |
	 |--> trunk = development area
	 |--> tags = tob will be used for brainstorming, code snippets, etc. 
 	 |--> branches = snapshots getting ready for release.
	 |--> releases = releases are kept here.

Join the SharkOS DevTeam
=========================
We hope to have a large Development Team (DevTeam) one day. The beginning of projects include a lot of work.
Since SharkOS is a Linux based Operating System and is open source, released under the GPLv3. We want to make clear here that all this work is dependant on volenteer work.

If you would like to spend some of your precious time, just email the DevTeam (devteam@shark-os.tk) and tell us about yourself, your age (this is needed for eventual legal purposes), what you would like to do and/or learn. If you would like to send a CV, then send that to hyperclock@shark-os.tk
